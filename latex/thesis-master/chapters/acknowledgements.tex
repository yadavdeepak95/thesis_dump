\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my thesis advisor Prof. Sandeep Shukla for being a wonderful mentor. His important suggestions and advice really helped me in my thesis. I thank him for all his teachings and guiding me in every possible way. It would never have been possible for me to complete the thesis without his constant support.

 I would also like to thank my senior, Ayushi Aggarwal for her valuable advises and co-operation throughout my thesis. I express my gratitude to my lab mates and my friends, for their continued support and encouragement. I also thank all the departmental staff of CSE Department for helping me during these years of my study both academically and officially.
 
 Also, I am grateful to my family for their support, and for keeping me motivated. It would not be possible to reach here without their efforts.
